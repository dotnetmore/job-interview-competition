### Job interview questions Iâ€™d ask:

- What happens when you type URL in a browser and press "enter"?
- Can you describe big O/theta/omega runtimes?
- What is "Boxing"? Should it be avoided?
- What is Garbage Collection? What are ways to speed GC runtime up?
- What is lock-free algorithm? What is use of it?
- Can you compare document-based databases with relational? When which one to choose?
- What features of C# 8 are doubtful? What are your favorite ones?
- How to allow to create objects only from the methods of your assembly?

#### How would you build (one on your choice) ...
- ... Instagram, FB or Telegram from scratch?
- ... KPI dashboard for system with huge amount of writes in load-profile

#### Working on few of your recent projects ...
- ... what you enjoyed the most?
- ... what was the most challenging task/bug for you to solve/fix?
- ... what would you do differently?
- ... have you had some conflicts? How they were solved?
